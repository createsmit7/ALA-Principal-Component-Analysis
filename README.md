# ALA-Principal-Component-Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation for a project on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) completed as part of the Applied Linear Algebra course.

##Overview

In this project, we explore the fundamental concept of PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data analysis and machine learning. The project is divided into two main sections:

Multinormal Data Analysis: We applied PCA to multinormal data, providing step-by-step visualizations to illustrate the dimensionality reduction process.

Iris Dataset PCA: We applied PCA to the popular Iris dataset and created visualizations to showcase its practical application and insights gained through dimensionality reduction.
